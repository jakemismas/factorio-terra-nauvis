# Exact coastlines: provenance

The emission manifests of `tools/build_geo.py emit --map <map> --bandfix` (milestone `coast-band-fix`;
the design notes section 13; ARCHITECTURE.md, "Build-time data flow"). Each manifest records the inputs
its K+ tables were built from (the map's shipped coast fit checkpoint from `data-src/fits/<map>/fit.json`,
the reference rasters `data-src/earthmaps/<map>-land.png` and `-thinwater.png`, each scale's waterway
manifest `data-src/waterways/manifest-<map>.json` and config.lua's `bandfix` group), the generated
files with their sha256 (`terra-nauvis/scripts/generated/bandfix_<map>_v1.lua`, the map's K+ table, and
`bandfix_<map>_s<k>_v1.lua`, each scale's waterway masks over it), and per scale the pricing: S12's
measures (`s12_rule`: the share of the map's chunks the band rule corrects and the tiles per corrected
chunk, mean, p95 and max, with the coast fit alone deciding) beside the shipped rule's (`shipped_rule`:
K pixels outside the scale's masks, fill pixels whole) and the chunks the handler reads
(`chunks_read`). The plan's T1 (offline, first) reads scales 1, 3 and 6. The T16 data-src row re-hashes
every file of this folder against the table below; `build_geo.py check --map <map> --bandfix`
re-emits the tables twice and compares each byte for byte with the committed files.

| File | sha256 | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest-atlantic.json` | `72c3a513e544ebeb2f6559ceb5a4b55e9356a0aa98cf97fdea9b4acef6d47dbf` | emission manifest |
| `manifest-europe.json` | `862aaff8ca587d1d616b7e3c7e1f3dac76558a8501a55ecb7b3f1a17a699da1e` | emission manifest |
| `manifest-olde_world.json` | `91e3d40c3cd3a449443d7bf783ab01f911fee9dd95be9d1be3d04fb606b7b6b2` | emission manifest |

2026-10-30: `bandfix.tables` gained Europe's geography 14 and Old World's 16 and 18 (the soft-edge
versions; the handler skips the edge band on them). The emitter reads that list only to check the
map's membership, so the tables are unchanged: both manifests' `bandfix_config_sha256` was re-stamped
to the new group (the old digest recomputes exactly from the new group with the old lists).
